==================================================
5.7.3 Commands Classes
	CCC: Card Command Classes
5.7.1 Command Types
	MSB: Most Significant Bit 最高有效位
	LSB: Least Significant Bit 最低有效位
5.7 Commands
==================================================
5.6.1 CRC and Illegal Command
	CRC: Cyclic Redundancy Code         Cyclic Redundancy Check
5.6 Error Conditions
==================================================
5.2.3 Card Identification Process
	ALL_SEND_CID(CMD2)
	SET_RELATIVE_ADDR(CMD3)
5.2.2 Operating Voltage Range Validation
	SEND_OP_COND (CMD1): provide MultiMediaCard hosts with a mechanism to identify and reject cards which do not match the host’s desired VDD range.
	GO_INACTIVE_STATE (CMD15)
5.2.1 Reset
	GO_IDLE_STATE (CMD0): software reset command and sets all MultiMediaCards to Idle State
5.2 Card Identification Mode
	Figure 5-1 MultiMediaCard State Diagram (Card Identification Mode)
==================================================
4.5.7 MultiMediaCard Registers in SPI Mode
4.5.6 RCA Register
	carries the card address assigned by the host during the card identification.
4.5.5 Status Register
4.5.4 CSD Register
	Card Specific Data (CSD) register: contains all the configuration information required in order to access the card data.
	CCC―The MultiMediaCard command set is divided into subsets (command classes). The card command class register CCC defines which command classes are supported by this card.
4.5.3 Card Identification (CID) Register
4.5.1 Operating Conditions Register (OCR)
4.5 MultiMediaCard Registers
	6 registers
		OCR, CID and CSD registers: carry the card configuration information.
		RCA register: holds the card relative communication address for the current session.
		DSR register: is not implemented in the SanDisk MultiMediaCard.
==================================================
1.5.7 Hot Insertion
	will be supported through connector.sssss
1.5.6 Automatic Sleep Mode
	Upon completion of an operation, the MultiMediaCard will enter the sleep mode to conserve power if no further commands are received within 5 msec. 
1.5.5 Using the Erasing Command
	a normal write operation includes a separate sector erase prior to write.
	so if a sector has been erased, write to that sector will be much faster.
1.5.3 Endurance
	SanDisk MultiMediaCards have an endurance specification for each sector of 300,000 writes (reading a logical sector is unlimited). 
	note: may vary if flash technology improves.
1.5.2 Defect and Error Management
	MultiMediaCards do a read after write, if a bit is defective, replace this bad bit with a spare bit in sector header.If necessary, replace the entire sector with a spare sector.
	ECC: Errot Correction Code
1.5.1
	sector size: 512 bytes
